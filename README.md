# Build ML workflow using Amazon Sagemaker

In this project, I've used AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. I have deploy your model, use AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose model and services into an event-driven application. At the end of this project, I have have created a portfolio-ready demo that is scalable, ML-enabled, AWS applications.
